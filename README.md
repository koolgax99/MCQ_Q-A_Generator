# MCQ_Q-A_Generator
This code basically produces MCQ question paper and its relevant answer sheet both separately. I have used the xlrd module in python and also this has to deal with the randomization function. The data set was already given to me which i am uploading. This is a fun code and i have not shown many variations in the type of the question. I have shown only three variations. Though it was a time bound hackathon of 3 hours. And also I had no information about this module so first I had to learn and then implement, which took me a lot of time. Thats why, i was not able to give variations in the type of question.
